Google SQL Proxy
========================

[SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy) is a tool made by Google, it allows you to connect to [Google MySQL Service](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) without IP restrictions and authentication mechanism [managed by IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam). Very useful when you are working with a cluster of auto-scaling instances, where all instances IP are ephemeral and auto-assigned.

Install
---------

Just run install command

```
./install.sh
```

Configuration
-------------

Depends from process manager  

**Run by init.d**

```
# Copy LSB file
cp init.d/cloud_sql_proxy /etc/init.d/cloud_sql_proxy

# Edit and move configuration file to secure folder as .sql_proxy file
cp init.d/sql_proxy.config /root/.sql_proxy

# Update runlevels (start at boot)
update-rc.d cloud_sql_proxy enable

# Manual Start / Stop commands
/etc/init.d/cloud_sql_proxy {start|stop|restart}

```

**Variables**

`INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`

Connection name available in Google SQL service

**Run by supervisor**

```
# Install supervisor

apt-get install supervisor -y

# Edit and copy configuration to supervisor conf folderÂ 

cp supervisor/cloud_sql_proxy.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/cloud_sql_proxy.conf

```

**Variables**

Check file `supervisor/cloud_sql_proxy.conf` and edit placeholders

`SET_NAME` set your process/program name

`COMMAND`add your supervisor managed process/program

Customize other values as you prefer.


Connect to MySQL database
-------------------------

Install mysql client on local machine then use command `mysql`with connection arguments

```
# Install MySQL Client
apt-get install mysql-client -y

# Connect to MySQL by SQL Proxy 
mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1
[password]
```

**MySQL root auto-login without password**

Set DB access credentials in `/root/.my.cnf`

```
[client]
username=root
password=ROOT_PASSWORD
host=127.0.0.1
```

You can access to MySQL server by `mysql` command without arguments, it also works with mysqldump command for quickly backup operations.

TODO

- Verify if .sql_proxy file exist and variables are set
